# SmartHome App

A simple **SmartHome demo application** built with [Felgo SDK](https://felgo.com/) and QML.  
The app demonstrates how to:

- Display devices in a **flow layout** on the home screen.
- Add new devices (plug, bulb, thermostat, camera, â€¦) dynamically.
- Manage **per-device settings pages** with navigation support.
- Use **drag & drop reordering** to rearrange devices in the home view.
- Store device data persistently with **Storage**.
- Generate documentation with **QDoc**.
